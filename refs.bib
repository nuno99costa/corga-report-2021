         abstract = {The authors propose a competing values approach to organizational effectiveness. Seven researchers in organizational behavior were impaneled to make judgments about the similarity of effectiveness criteria derived from a comprehensive list. A spatial model was developed from the judgment data. It indicated that three value dimensions, focus (task--people), structure (control--flexibility), and time (short-term--long-term) underlie conceptualizations of organizational effectiveness. Furthermore, the model suggested some fundamental criteria of organizational effectiveness that differentially reflect these three value dimensions. The present research uses this competing values approach to resolve a number of existing problems in the organizational effectiveness literature.},
